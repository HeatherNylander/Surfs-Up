# Surfs-Up

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
#### Purpose
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Summary
##### Results Summary
Both months seem adequite for running a surf and ice cream shop.
##### Two Additional Queries to Run
- Include latitude and longitude coordinates to localize weather data to the surf shop instead of the whole island.
- Include precipitation since the temperature may not be a great enough factor. People may surf or eat ice cream while it's a cooler temperature but not while it's raining.
